  concept: <<~HEREDOC,
    Let’s break it down:

    <p><strong>puts</strong> — This tells Ruby to say something. It prints to the screen.</p>

    <p><strong>Variables</strong> — Think of these as little boxes where Ruby can store information. You can name your box (like <code>name</code> or <code>age</code>) and fill it with stuff (like <code>'Alex'</code> or <code>27</code>).</p>

    <p>📦 <strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>name = 'Alex'
puts "Hello, \#{name}!"</code></pre>

    <p>🧪 <strong>What’s happening?</strong> We store <code>'Alex'</code> in the box called <code>name</code>. Then we ask Ruby to say “Hello, Alex!” by using <code>\#{name}</code> — that’s called <em>string interpolation</em> (fancy term, easy trick).</p>

  description: <<~HEREDOC,
    Let’s talk to your computer! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make Ruby say things and remember stuff using variables.

    It’s like giving your computer a brain… and a voice.

  task: <<~HEREDOC,
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> Make Ruby Your Hype Buddy</p>

    <p>Write a short Ruby program that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stores your name in a variable.</li>
      <li>Stores your favorite snack in another variable.</li>
      <li>Uses <code>puts</code> to print a fun message like:<br> Hey Sam! Let's grab some popcorn and code together! 🚀</li>
    </ul>

    <p>💬 Use your own name and snack. Make it YOU.</p>
