# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.

puts â€” This tells Ruby to say something. It prints to the screen.

Variables â€” Think of these as little boxes where Ruby can store information. You can name your box (like name or age) and fill it with stuff (like 'Alex' or 27).

ðŸ“¦ Example: name = 'Alex'
puts 'Hello, \#{name}!',

ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s happening? We store 'Alex' in the box called name. Then we ask Ruby to say 'Hello, Alex!' by using \#{name} â€” thatâ€™s called string interpolation (fancy term, easy trick).",
